## Overview

This project showcases my ten maps created for the 2025 #30DayMapChallenge (originally shared on LinkedIn). Each map explores a different theme, dataset, or visualization approach, highlighting a range of geospatial analysis techniques, data processing workflows, and cartographic design choices.

The goal of this project is both technical and creative: to experiment with diverse mapping styles while demonstrating practical GIS and data visualization skills using multiple tools and data sources.
